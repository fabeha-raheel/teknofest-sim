# Teknofest Sim

This repository contains the source code of the Teknofest 2022 International UAV Competition. The main theme of the Competition was Water Transportation. In the first lap of the mission, the UAVs are supposed to complete an autonomous mission around competition area, detect the target areas (blue water pickup area and red target drop off area), estimate the location of these target areas as precisely as possile. In the second lap, the drones navigate towards these target areas and have to land precisely at the center of the target areas using vision-based control.

The algorithms have been successfully tested in Gazebo simulation. Hardware validation has been partially achieved.
